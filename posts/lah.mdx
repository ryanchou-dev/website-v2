<br />
this is a vivid recollection of my experience at [Los Altos Hacks VII](https://losaltoshacks.com/)!
an 27 hour in-person hackathon at Juniper Aspiration Dome. i teamed up with [@maggie-j-liu](https://github.com/maggie-j-liu)
to make [Magicard](https://github.com/maggie-j-liu/magicard)! a website that allows
you to attach video the physical cards that people can view using ✨ AR ✨!

<br />
although it was super crowded, it was still rly fun!
<br />

# 🕙 10:00AM

<br />
The venue felt a lot different from when we went ~2 weeks prior because of all the
people. It used to feel hollow and empty, but now, it feels... 🐛 alive?

<br />

when we got inside the venue, it was already **super** crowded. it was a bit hard to find a place to sit,
but we eventually found a spot. afterward, we went to go check out the sponsor tables! there were a bunch,
and it was super fun to pick up all the free swag 👕.

# 🕚 11:00AM

<br />
so, their opening ceremony took like an hour because of all of their sponsors (they
had so many 😩), but it gave us a chance to brainstorm more and check out all the
tracks. We were especially excited by all of the food that they were gonna give us.
(plus a "midnight surprise" &mdash; although we were able to guess it by the sponsors
😍🧋)

# 🕛 12:00PM

<br />

we were pretty excited about using Niantic's 8th Wall to develop an AR app,
so we spent some time brainstorming ideas and looking at the documentation/example projects.
we also ate lunch, which was an enormous slice of pizza, no idea why they ordered that much LMAO.

# 🕝 2:30PM
<br />

we attended the first workshop, which was about using 8th Wall to make a web AR app.
it was pretty interesting, and the speaker was very enthusiastic :D

<br />
after this, we decided on making Magicard, with

# 🕓 4:00PM
<br />

[RUIEN](https://rluo.dev) APPEARANCE!

<br />
sliding over the fact i almost asked a random kid if he was Ruien because i didn't
know what he looked like, it was super fun to meet him irl for the first time, and
he was super nice.
<br />

he also got an amazing custom ID card, which you should totally scan if you can ;)

<br />

<br />

# 🕛 12:00AM

<br />

hacking! we did a lot of work on the website and got most of the content out.
we got AR working in the browser, and we were able to scan image targets and view the videos.
after this, we set up the video recording, and I worked on the design, while Maggie set up video
uploading and connecting it to the 8th Wall project.

<br />
other than that, we ate dinner, did cup stacking, participated in a CTF round, and
drank a lot of boba 🧋.
<br />
plus, the sponsors for bill.com had left for the night, and we took over their sponsor
table!! we were able to do some [Sprig](https://sprig.hackclub.com/) advertising
(with the poster Ruien gave us)

<br />

# 🕖 7:00AM

<br />
pretty fun, we worked until about 3AM. when everybody decided to go to sleep, i chose
to stay up, chug 3 cups of boba, and honestly accomplish like nothing. i can hardly
remember anything about this time. i think i was high.
<br />
in fact this all-nighter was so severe, i lost my taste for boba for (almost) an
entire day 😱😱😱
